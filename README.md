# Brainfuck Interpreter

[Ukko](https://github.com/TheZeus121) recently challenged me to writing a Brainfuck interpreter. He explained how Brainfuck works, and I managed to code it. (Took 2 days to debug it though)

It's pretty interesting, actually. I think I might try writing Brainfuck programs to run on my interpreter, since Ukko recommended [this](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/)
